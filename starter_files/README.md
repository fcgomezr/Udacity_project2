# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project, we have used <a href= 'https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv'> Bank Marketing dataset </a> to train a machine learning model using AutoML feature of Azure Machine Learning Studio and later configure it for production and deploy it using Azure Container Instance and later consume it using REST endpoints. We will also create, publish and consume a pipeline.

## Architectural Diagram

*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
